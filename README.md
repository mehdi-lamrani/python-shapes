### Basic Geometric Shapes OOP Project ###

The goal of this workshop is to illustrate Object Oriented Programming Principles
through the implementation of shape classes and methods, leveraging inheritance and abstract classes

It also introduces the organisation of a python project into modules and packages, and illustrates the usage of test driven developement through pytest

#### TODO : ####

- 1. Extend the model add shape classes of your own
- 2. Make use of the rendering capabilities and the GUI Rendering class to tie it up to the shapes <br>
     and be able to draw the shapes upon the call of the render method of each shape.
- 3. Extend the testing thoroughly to all the shapes
