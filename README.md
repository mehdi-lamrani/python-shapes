The goal of this workshop is to illustrate Object Oriented Programming Principles
through the implementation of shape classes and methods, leveraging inheritance and abstract classes

It also illustrate the usage of testing through pytest

#### TODO : ####

- 1. Extend the model add shape classes of your own
- 2. Make use of the rendering capabilities and the GUI Rendering class to tie it up to the shapes
- 3. Extend the testing thoroughly to all the shapes
